# Get_AppleID_From_Macbook
Get the Apple ID and other useful information from a locked MacBook (Recovery mode)

You will have to watch the video on how to get the file off the macbook, after that, all you need is the IODeviceTree.txt file

Feel free to send PULL requests to actually make this work 100% - This is a simple POC
